This is an Arduino project I did when I was first learning to program.
This project reads changes in resistance from a Thermistor 
(a resistor that changes its resistance based on temperature) and then uses Steinhart's equation to turn that into a temperature.
From there it puts those readings onto an in-built LCD.
